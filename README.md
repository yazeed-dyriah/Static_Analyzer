1_ magic number : 

first, i read number from eof txt file
I wrote a Python code to test  the user entered code from file if the code include these cases its a magic number:

- If the variable is preceded by ==, then it is a magic number.
- If it is in the code Fail, Pass, Unknown then it is Magic Streng.
- If the code has a comparison operation such as: >, <, >=, <= then it is magic number.
- If it precedes it = then it is not your magic number.
