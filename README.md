first, i read number from eof txt file
I wrote a Python code to test  the user entered code from file if the code include these cases its a magic number:

- If the variable is preceded by ==, then it is a magic number.
- If it is in the code Fail, Pass, Unknown then it is Magic Streng.
- If the code has a comparison operation such as: >, <, >=, <= then it is magic number.
- If it precedes it = then it is not your magic number.


2_Unreachable code after return statement :
read the lines in the text file which is below (return) and give an error message , and if the line after  return is (for,if,},{,) it will not give an error message on it.

3_ No more than 3 paramers:

I read the code in the txt file 
I wrote a python code to  count the number of (',') in the line and check if line is functiona , by check if it is start with (def) ,then I check if it is a function and the value
of the comma counter is more than 3 it will get an error message.
